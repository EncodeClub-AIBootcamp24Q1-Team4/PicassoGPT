## Encode AI Bootcamp Project Week 3 - PaintingAssistant by Guy Cioffi 4KTBAl

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Summary
This project is an image prompt generator with an AI assistant. The assistant generates a prompt based off user selected parameters: style, mood and theme. Then you can generate an image based off the prompt provided by the AI assistant.

## Project Puropose
Build a simple web app to learn about AI assistants and image generation.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

**Note: App requires env variables of an OpenAI API Key, Assistant ID, and Thread ID.**
